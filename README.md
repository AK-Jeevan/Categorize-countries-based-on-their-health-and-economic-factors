# Categorize-countries-based-on-their-health-and-economic-factors
This project applies k-means clustering to group countries based on socio-economic and health indicators. The goal is to help HELP International, a humanitarian NGO, identify nations most in need of aid by analyzing factors like child mortality, income, health spending, and life expectancy.
